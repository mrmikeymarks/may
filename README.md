## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Create a directory for May
mkdir may && cd may

# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannymcc/may/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start the container in the background
docker compose up -d
```

The web service uses Docker's `always` restart policy, so it is restarted
automatically if the process or host goes down.

Or run directly with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name may \
  -p 5050:5050 \
  -v may_data:/app/data \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  ghcr.io/dannymcc/may:latest
```

> **Running as a specific user (PUID/PGID):** May follows the [linuxserver.io](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid/) convention. Set the optional `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables to make the container run as a specific host user/group so bind-mounted data is owned correctly. They default to `1000:1000`. On Unraid, set `PUID=99` and `PGID=100`.

Access the application at `http://localhost:5050`

**First-time login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: Check your container logs for the auto-generated password

On first run, if no `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable is set, May generates a secure random password and prints it to the console:

```
============================================================
SECURITY NOTICE: Default admin account created
Username: admin
Password: <randomly-generated-password>
Please change this password immediately after first login!
Set ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable to avoid this message.
============================================================
```

To view the password, run:
```bash
docker logs may
```

💡 **Tip:** Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your docker-compose.yml or environment to use a fixed password.

### Deploy via Portainer (GitHub Stack)

Use this repository directly as a Portainer stack source with the Portainer-specific compose file:

- Compose file: `docker-compose-port.yaml`
- Env file: `stack.env`

In Portainer, go to **Stacks** -> **Add stack** and choose **Repository**.

Set:

- Repository URL: `https://github.com/dannymcc/may.git`
- Repository reference: your target branch/tag (for example `main` or `dev`)
- Compose path: `docker-compose-port.yaml`

Then configure environment values in one of these ways:

1. Paste the key/value pairs from `stack.env` into Portainer's **Environment variables** section.
2. Or commit your own adjusted `stack.env` in your fork and reference it with Portainer if your setup supports env file loading for Git stacks.

Minimum values you should customize before deploy:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `MAY_TAG` (`latest` for stable, `dev` for development)
- `MAY_PORT` (host port to expose)

Production hardening tips:

- Set `MAY_CONTAINER_NAME` to a unique value per environment (for example `may-prod`, `may-staging`) to avoid container name conflicts when running multiple stacks on the same Docker host.
- Use a dedicated persistent volume per stack/environment so data is isolated. If you deploy multiple stacks from this same compose file, keep separate stack names (or adjust volume naming) so each stack gets its own `may_data` volume.

After deployment, open `http://<your-host>:<MAY_PORT>`.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python run.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Secret key for session encryption
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-random-string

# Database location (default: SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/data/may.db

# Optional external databases
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://may:may@postgres:5432/may
# DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://may:may@mysql:3306/may
# DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://may:may@mariadb:3306/may

# Upload folder for attachments
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/app/data/uploads
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Session encryption key | Random |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:////app/data/may.db` in Docker |
| `DB_ENGINE` | Optional DB builder: `sqlite`, `postgres`, `postgresql`, `mysql`, `mariadb` | `sqlite` |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` | Host and port used when `DATABASE_URL` is omitted | Engine defaults |
| `DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` | Database credentials used when `DATABASE_URL` is omitted | `may` |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | SQLite file used when `DATABASE_URL` is omitted | `data/may.db` |
| `UPLOAD_FOLDER` | Path for file uploads | `/app/data/uploads` |
| `PUID` | User ID the container runs as (linuxserver.io convention) | `1000` |
| `PGID` | Group ID the container runs as (linuxserver.io convention) | `1000` |
| `TAILWIND_ASSET_URL` | Local Tailwind Play CDN JS path | `/static/vendor/tailwindcss.js` |
| `TAILWIND_CDN_URL` | Tailwind CDN fallback URL | `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` |
| `HTMX_CDN_URL` | HTMX CDN URL | `https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10` |

By default, Tailwind loads from `app/static/vendor/tailwindcss.js` and falls back to the CDN URL if the local asset is missing.

### Database Options

May defaults to SQLite so existing compose deployments keep working unchanged. For a separate database server, set `DATABASE_URL` and start the matching compose profile:

```bash
# PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://may:may@postgres:5432/may docker compose --profile postgres up -d

# MySQL
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://may:may@mysql:3306/may docker compose --profile mysql up -d

# MariaDB
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://may:may@mariadb:3306/may docker compose --profile mariadb up -d
```

`postgres://`, `postgresql://`, `mysql://`, and `mariadb://` URLs are normalized to bundled drivers automatically. Existing SQLite recovery remains SQLite-only; external databases should be kept current with Alembic migrations (`flask db upgrade`, run automatically by the container entrypoint).

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer may_your_api_key" \
  http://localhost:5050/api/v1/vehicles
```

See the API documentation at `/api/docs` when logged in.

Calendar/reminder automation endpoints include:
- `GET/POST /api/v1/reminders`
- `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/reminders/{id}`
- `GET/POST /api/v1/calendar/events`
- `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/calendar/events/{id}`
- `POST /api/v1/calendar/events/{id}/sync/caldav`
- `GET /api/v1/calendar/metadata`

## 🔗 Integrations

### Home Assistant
Create vehicle sensors in Home Assistant:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: "May Vehicle Stats"
    resource: http://your-may-instance/api/ha/summary
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer may_your_api_key
    value_template: "{{ value_json.alerts_count }}"
    json_attributes:
      - total_vehicles
      - total_cost
```

Available endpoints: `/api/ha/status`, `/api/ha/vehicles`, `/api/ha/alerts`, `/api/ha/summary`

### Calendar Subscription
Subscribe to reminders in your calendar app:

1. Go to Settings > Integrations > Calendar
2. Copy the webcal URL (for Apple Calendar, Outlook) or HTTPS URL (for Google Calendar)
3. Add as a subscribed calendar in your app

The calendar includes:
- Maintenance schedules
- Recurring expense due dates
- Document expiry dates
- Custom reminders
- Generic calendar events created through the REST API

### CalDAV Publishing

Generic calendar events can be pushed to a CalDAV collection with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/v1/calendar/events/1/sync/caldav \
  -H "Authorization: ******" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "calendar_url": "https://calendar.example.com/user/default/",
    "username": "calendar-user",
    "password": "calendar-password"
  }'
```

Credentials supplied to this endpoint are used for that sync request only; the event stores the remote calendar URL and ETag for later updates.
